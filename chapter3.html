                What is OSI Model?
            </dt>
            <DD>
                It is a conceptual model that describes the universal standard of communication function of
                telecommunication system or computing system, without any regards to the systems underlying without
                technology and specific protocol suites.
                The OSI model stand for “open system interconnection”. It has developed by standard organization ISO
                (international
                organization for standardization) in the year 1984.It is a conceptual framework used to describe the
                function of
                networking system. The OSI model is still used today as a means to describe the networking
                architecture.
                It
                has seven
                layer architecture were each layer has specific functionality. All these layer works together to
                transmit
                the data from
                one network to another network across the globe. Each layer has fixed layer no in each time either
                sending
                the data or
                receiving the data. The layers are namely application layer, presentation layer, session layer,
                transport
                layer, data
                link layer, physical layer. first three, layer is called massage layer or as software layer. And the
                last
                three layer is
                called hardware layer.

            <li>Modularity</li>

            <li> Flexibility</li>
            <li>Independent of Nature</li>
            <li> Specific implementation of its function can be modified or replaced.</li>
            <li>For abstract representation of data</li>

                will use the data network. It allows the user to use the network. for example, it provides the
                network-based service the end user. Example of network servics are distributed databases, electronic
                mail, resource sharing, file transfers, remote file access and network management. This layer defines
                the nature of the task to be performed.It provides user interface to communicate with the computer.
                In this layer message is preparing, file transfer, access and management being done.

                The presentation layer translate the data based on application layer.
                It also allow to compression service.The presentation layer concerned with presentation of data where
                supports special processing on the data from the time application attempts to send it till the time it
                is sent over network. Thus, it responsible for issues that may where data sent from system needs to be
                viewed in different way by other system. presentation layer performs functions related to syntax
                semantics of information transmitted. This includes formatting displaying received data terminals
                printers. It concerned differences in the syntax used communicating applications. This layer responsible
                remedying those differences resorting mechanisms transform the syntax (specific to platform question)
                common one for purpose of exchange. example, performs encoding of data in standard, agreed-upon way
                facilitates information exchange among heterogeneous systems using different codes strings, example,
                conversion between ASCII EBCDIC character codes. facilitates data compression reducing number of bits to
                transmitted encrypts data privacy authentication, necessary. Some of specific types of handling issues
                that presentation layer provides are follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Translation: Different types of computers like PCs, Macintoshes UNIX systems, AS/400 servers,
                        etc., in an internetwork have many distinct characteristics and represent data in different
                        ways. It is the responsibility of the presentation layer to hide these differences between
                        different machines for seamless and easy exchange of data between two hosts working on different
                        machines. The translation function is sometimes not needed.</li>
                    <li>
                        Compression: Compression and decompression are also carried out a
                        The presentation layer to improve the throughput of data. However, these
                        functions are optional.</li>

                    <li> Encryption: Some types of encryption and decryption are performed the presentation layer to
                        ensure the security of the data as it passes down the protocol stack. These are also optional.
                    </li>
                    Sometimes, the presentation layer functions are taken care of by the cation layer and the functions
                    like translation, compression/decompression encryption/ decryption are not always required. Due to
                    these facts, the presentation layer is often skipped in actual protocol stack implementations; and
                    it possible for Layer 7 to directly talk to layer 5 in the OSI model.

                This layer controls the conversation between two computer .IT
                also include authentication and reconnection. That means after the connection is lost and some data are
                transferred it will reconnect andstart transfer the data continuously, after this the data moving
                forward to transport layer. The session layer is the lowest of the three upper layers and deals mainly
                software application issues only. It helps enable devices to establish and e sessions. Primarily, a
                session is a persistent logical linking of two software action processes to exchange data over a
                specified period of time. The session s responsible for establishing, maintaining, and arbitrating the
                dialogs n communicating applications. It also provides enhanced services useful in applications, for
                example, remote login, remote file transfer, etc. It is also responsible for orderly recovery from
                failures by implementing appropriate Dinting mechanisms. The applications on either side of the session
                can get data or send packets to another for as long as the session lasts. The session handles session
                message exchanges and terminates when session ends. It coordinates monitors session identification so
                that designated parties participate. It provides security services control access session information.
                session allows hosts establish session between them which ordinary transport allowed. session layer

                This layer is accept data from session layer, and split into smaller unit called segment. in this
                layer also checking the error and the flow of data. also it responsible for end-to-end communication
                over a
                network.
                This medium is also known as heart of this system, because it converted the data into small bundle which

                of
                TCP.
                it also alert that the data is transferred or not And Without Establish use UDP for fast transferring

                        <b>Process-Level Addressing:</b> Like Layers 2 and 3, the transport layer also deals with the
                        addressing issue but quite differently in which it is used to differentiate between software
                        programs or different applications. This function of the transport layer enables many different
                        software programs or applications to use a network layer protocol simultaneously.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Multiplexing and Demultiplexing:</b> It enables a sending device to multiplex the data
                        received from many application programs for transport, and demultiplex the data received while
                        acting as the receiving side.

                        large amounts of data into small pieces on the source machine to transmit across the network and
                        then reassemble them on the destination machine.

                        <b> Connection Establishment, Management and Termination:</b> The connection-oriented protocols
                        at the transport layer establish a connection, maintain it as data is sent over it and then
                        terminate the connection when it is no longer required for the series of communications.

                        data reliably which is accomplished by using a variety of techniques, most commonly the
                        combination of acknowledgments and retransmission of data if data is not delivered successfully.

                        bogged down with data. In other words, this function manages mismatches in speed between the

                In this layer the segment of data is converted into packet. It contain the address of data where the
                data is coming from and where to go. Together It also decided in what format and which path, data will
                send
                to the
                receiver that in fast. That means all the work of router complete in this layer.
                The key functions of the network layer are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Logical Addressing:</b> The devices communicating across a network have logical addresses
                        which are
                        known as layer three addresses. Internet Protocol (IP) is an example of Layer 3 addressing.
                        Unlike, data link addressing that deals only with local physical devices, the logical addresses
                        at Layer 3 are independent of particular hardware and unique across an entire internetwork.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b> Routing:</b> It is the key function of Layer 3 in which data is routed across interconnected
                        networks to deliver finally at the host destination. This is accomplished with the help of
                        devices like routers and software routines that function at the network layer to handle incoming
                        packets from various sources and determine routes for their final destination so that they could
                        be delivered reliably there.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <b>Datagram Encapsulation:</b> The network layer functions to encapsulate messages received from
                        higher
                        layers by placing them into datagrams with a network layer header. Datagrams are also referred
                        to as packets.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Fragmentation and Reassembly:</b> The network layer passes down messages to the data link
                        layer for
                        transmission through the physical layer over the transmission media to other networks or the
                        local network. The network layer also splits large packets into smaller packets according to the
                        limits imposed on the length of the packet by the data link layer. This process is called
                        fragmentation. Thus, the fragmented pieces are put together at the network layer of the
                        destination machine. This process is called the reassembly of packets.

                            The function of the network layer may be summarized as follows:</b> The main role of the
                        network
                        layer is to accept packets from a source and deliver them to a destination machine. The network
                        layer provides services that should be independent of router technology. It shields the
                        transport layer from the router details and facilities consistent network addressing-across
                        network.
                        It also shields the above layers from details about the underlying network (the network topology
                        and road map) and the routing technology that might have been deployed to connect different
                        networks together.

            <dt>LAYER GROUPINGS:</dt>
            <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp; The seven layers of the OSI Model are categorized into two-layer groupings. The lower
                layers are Layers
                1, 2, 3, and 4 and the upper layers are Layers 5, 6 and 7. The physical, data link, network and
                transport layers, which are the lower layers of the OSI model primarily deal with the formatting,
                encoding and transmission of data over the network without caring to know much about the data, its
                usage, etc They define how data is transferred through a physical wire or through switches and routers
                and how to rebuild a data stream from a transmitting host to a destination host's application. The lower
                layers are implemented using both hardware and software with the incidence of hardware reducing to
                software from Layer I to Layer 4.

                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The top three layers define the way the applications within the end stations will
                communicate with each
                other and with users while the bottom four layers define how data is transmitted end-to-end. The higher
                layers of the model-the session, presentation and application layers primarily deal with user interface
                and implement the applications that run over the network irrespective of knowing how data is delivered
                from one place to another by the low-level layers. These layers are almost always implemented using
                software running on a computer or other hardware devices like routers, gateways, etc. The application
                layer along with other upper layers provides the user interface and applications communicating between
                hosts. The upper layers are not expected to know anything about networking or network addresses. The
                bottom four layers take the responsibility of networking and network addresses.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;Some layers, like data and physical layers, are further divided into sublayers. These sublayers
            precisely define the internal details of technologies and protocols at those layers. Some OSI layers are
            related to each other. The data and physical link layers are considered closely related, and so are the
            network and transport layers, within the lower-level grouping. In case of the upper layers, the line
            dividing each layer from the other is so blurred that many technologies implement two or even all three of
            these layers.</p>

        <h3>INTERACTION BETWEEN OSI LAYERS </h3>
        <p>In this section, we will discuss the about the interaction between OSI layers.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>


                <b>OSI Interfaces:</b> The OSI interface is a process of communication between adjacent layers in which
                data is passed between layer N of the model and layer N-1 or layer N+1. The layer 3/4 interface is used
                by a Layer 3 and Layer 4 protocol to pass control and data information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Vertical Communication:</b> This refers to communication up and down the protocol stack every time
                any data is sent or received across the network. This is because there exits only logical connections
                between corresponding layers of the OSI models of hosts machines, not actual physical connections. At
                the sending end, data passes through the higher layer to the physical layer so that it may be
                transmitted across the network to the receiving end. At the receiving end, the process is reversed so
                that the data can travel back up to the higher layers of the receiving device and to the user interface.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Modularity and Inter-Layer Interactions:</b> The OSI model supports the interconnection of different
                implementations of various autonomous layers. This is done through interfaces in which each layer should
                provide a consistent, well-documented interface to the layers above it so that any upper layer
                implementation can use the lower layer properly.

                <b>Protocols:</b> These are sets of agreed rules, procedures, instructions and/or functions describing
                one type of communication between specific
                software and hardware elements running at the same layer on different machines within a network. They
                have their own language. Some of them are similar to each other while others are quite unique,

            <li> <b>horizontal Communication: </b> Each layer in OSI Mosel has been assigned set of tasks for which it
                is responsible and these tasks usually come under protocols defined for that particular layer.
                Horizontal communication defines that a process running at a particular layer on one host machine can
                accomplish logical communication with a similar process running at the same layer on another host
                machine. As both the host machines are only physically connected at the physical layer. therefore the
                data on the sending host machine needs to pass down through the layers between the higher layers to the
                physical layer. Thereafter, the data is transmitted through the transmission media to the physical layer
                of the other host machine and pushed up to the similar layer of the receiving host machine. In this
                manner, the two communicating hosts are logically connected at that particular layer.


            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp; For example, a protocol running at Layer 6 in the sending host machine passes down to Layer I of the
            same machine and is then transmitted over the transmission media to the Layer I of the receiving host
            machine. It is then pushed up to Layer 6 of the receiving host machine where a logical connection is
            established between Layer 6 of the sending host machine and Layer 6 of the receiving host machine. Thus, a
            protocol running at a particular layer in a host machine establishes a logical connection with a similar
            layer in another host machine. In fact, they have no physical connection at that layer. This is the
            horizontal connection that enables a protocol at a particular layer to perform its assigned job by creating
            a logical communication with the corresponding layer at the other side of the communicating host machine.
            However, the horizontal communication between similar layers also requires vertical communication, except in
            case of communication between Layers 6 and 1.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
            <b>Protocol Data Units (PDUs):</b> Protocols describe the rules to control horizontal communication for
            exchanging data between processes running at corresponding layers within the OSI model. Except Layer 1, all
            layers include their data in the message that is exchanged between corresponding software elements on two or
            more than two devices in the network. This additional data appended at each layer, except Layer 1, is
            mechanism for communicating information between protocols and is known as PDUS or Protocol Data Units. Each
            PDU is specified by a specific format that implements the requirements and features of the protocol.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
            <b>Service Data Units (SDUs):</b> The communication between corresponding layer except Layer 1 is logical
            communication. Here, a protocol communicates by passing down its PDU to the next lower layer for
            transmission. On the other hand, the lower layers provide services to the layers immediately above them. One
            example of such a service is to manage and handle data received from the layer above. A PDU is considered in
            itself as a complete message at a particular layer. say N. When this layer N PDU is passed down to layer
            N-1, it becomes the data for the layer N-1 and the protocol for layer N-1 is expected to provide service.
            Thus, the layer N PDU becomes the Service Data Unit (SDU) for the layer N-1. Sometimes, SDU is also called
            or the message body or payload.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
            <b>Data Encapsulation:</b> N PDU, when transported to the N-1 layer, becomes N SDU for the N-1 layer. The
            layer N-1 transports N SDU to the next lower layer by placing the layer N SDU into its own PDU format. This
            process is known as data encapsulation in which the entire message including SDUS of higher layers are
            encapsulated as the data payload of the message at the lower layer. This process continues till the message
            reaches the physical layer.
