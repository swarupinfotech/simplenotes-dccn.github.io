        <h1>Types of Network</h1>
        <p>

            <b>Types of Networks: LAN, MAN, WAN and the Internet
            </b>
            &nbsp;
            Computers connected by many different technologies. An are interconnection between more than one computer,
            over a virtual and shared connection, in a client-to-server or peer-to-peer manner is called a network. That
            is to say, so that the flow of information is accommodated, computer resources are connected using networks.
            This is just the opposite of the old terminal-to-host hardwired connection. Although a network can support
            terminal-to-host connections through terminal emulators or a terminal server, it offers a lot more
            flexibility in switching connections. The disadvantage of this explosion in terms of sharing information
            arises when one computer wishes to share its information system with another which has different network
            protocols and different network technology. As a result, even if you could agree on a type of network
            technology to physically interconnect the two computers at different locations, your applications still
            would not be able to communicate with each other because of the different protocols.
            <br> &nbsp;
            A very basic question arises about the requirement of networks. This may be justified with the help of the
            following points:
        <ul>
            <li>Sharing of resources can be easily done.</li>
            <li>Reliability: There is no central computer, so if one breaks down you can use others.
                <br>
                â€¢ Networks allow you to be mobile.
            </li>
            The term networking applies to:
            <li>
                The exchange of information among institutions, groups or individuals.</li>
            <li>The process of data communications or electronic voice.</li>

        </ul>
        <b> Communication networks are broadly categorized into three categories follows:</b>

        </p>
        <p><a name="LAN"></a> <b>Local Area Network</b>&nbsp;

            The Local Area Network (LAN) technology connects machines and people within a site. LAN is a network that is
            restricted to a relatively small area as shown in Figure 9. LANS can be defined as privately-owned networks
            offering reliable high speed communication channels that are optimized to connect information processing
            equipment in a small and restricted geographical area, namely, an office, a building, a complex of
            buildings, a school or a campus.
            <hr>
            <br>&nbsp;
            A LAN is a form of local (limited-distance), shared packet network for computer communications. LANs
            interconnect peripherals and computers over a common medium so that users are able to share access to
            peripherals, files. databases, applications and host computers. They can also provide a connection to other
            networks either through a computer, which is attached to both networks, or through a dedicated device called
            a gateway.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp; The components used by LANs can be categorized into hardware, cabling protocols and standards. Various
            LAN protocols are Ethernet, Token Ring: Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), NetBIOS and NetBeui, TCP/IP, Fiber
            Distributed data interchange(FDDI),SMB and IPX/SPX.</p>
        <p> <a name="MAN"></a> <b> Metropolitan Area Network</b>
            <img src="https://beginnersbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Metropolitan_Area_Network_MAN.png" alt="metropolitan area network"><br>&nbsp;
            Such large geographic areas districts, towns cities by Metropolitan Area Network (MAN). linking or
            interconnecting smaller networks within large geographic area, information conveniently distributed
            throughout the network. Local libraries and government agencies use MAN to establish a link with private
            industries and citizens. also connect MANS together within a larger area than: LAN. The geographical limit
            of a MAN may span city. figure depicts how a MAN may be available within a city.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <p> &nbsp; In MAN, different LANS connected through local telephone

            exchange. Some of the widely protocols MAN are ATM RS-232, OC-3 lines Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line
            (ADSL), Frame Relay, Integrated Services Network (ISDN) and Mbps), etc. These protocols are quite different
            from those used LANs.
        </p>
        <p><a name="WAN"></a> <b>Wide Area network </b><br>&nbsp;
            This technology connects sites that are in diverse locations. Wide Area Network (WANs) connects such as
            large geographic areas, the world, India or New Delhi. There is no geographical limit of WAN. This kind of
            network can be connected by using satellite uplinks or dedicated transoceanic. Hence, a a WAN be defined as
            a data communications network covering a relatively broad geographical area to connect LANS together between
            different cities with the help of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone
            companies. WAN technologies operate at the lower three layers of the OSI may

            reference model. These are the physical data link and network layers. <br>&nbsp;
            Figure explains the WAN, which connects many LAN together. It also uses switching technology provided by
            local exchange and long distance carrier.

            <br>
            &nbsp; Packet switching technologies, such as Frame Relay, SMDS, ATM and X.25 are used to implement WAN
            along with statistical multiplexing to allow devices to use and share these circuits.
