                    <dt> What do you mean by information technology?</dt>
                    <dd>Information Technology is an area in which we study the designing, development and management of
                        computer
                        and
                        technology.
                        We also know the use of computer, software application and hardware to create process, secure
                        and
                        exchange
                        the
                        electronic data.
                        Today, each and every work done by computer and things related to it like internet, networking,
                        data
                        management,
                        software, internet website, server database etc. are the part of Information technology.
                        Thus, we can say that IT is an area/field in which computer related work is done according to
                        their
                        business.

                    <dt>Role of computer network in Information Technology?</dt>
                    <dd>It is a branch of Information technology In which we study the process of building, using and
                        maintaining
                        computer
                        networks. Including hardware, software and protocols. So, that multiple computing device can
                        share data.
                        It
                        is a
                        system of connected id computing devices and share information and resource between them.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>Why so we study computer network?</dt>
                    <dd> We study computer networking because it helps to the users on the network o share the resource
                        and
                        communication
                        between them. It is just like pillar or infrastructure of computing field . we must have the
                        basic
                        concept
                        of howe
                        things works, how internet works. In order to do such thing from internet. So we study the
                        computer
                        network.

                <dt> What is network Hardware and Software?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Network Hardware are electronic devices or network equipment required for communication and
                    interaction
                    between
                    devices in a computer network. Ex :- Router, Hubs, Switches, bridge etc,
                    While,
                    Network Software are programs designed for efficient network performance and monitoring. It
                    helps us to
                    define
                    locations of data storage and allow user to access that data.
                    Hardware required + Software Required = Computer Networking
                    Ex:- NIC Card(Network interface controller) :- It is a computer hardware component that connects
                    a
                    computer
                    to
                    connects a computer to computer network.
                    Network driver is a software program that connect a computer network.</dd>

                    LINE CONFIGURATION :- <br>
                    It refers to the way to connect physically two or more computer network.</p>
                <b>
                    Two types of physical connection:-
                </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Point-to-point</li>
                    <li>Multipoint</li>
                </ul>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Point-to-point</dt>
                    <dd> A point to point connection provides dedicated link between those two devices. Most point to
                        point connection use, an actual length of wire or cable to connect the two ends, but other
                        options such as microwave or satelite links are also possible.</dd>
                    <dt>Multipoint</dt>
                    <dd>multidrop configuration. In this connection, two or more device share links.

                        more than the two device share the link that is capacity of the channel shared now. With shared
                        capacity there can be two possibilities in a multipoint line configuration.

                        spatial sharing:- if several devices can share the link simultaneously. it's called spatially
                        shared line. configuration.

                        Temporal (Time) sharing:- if users must link take turns using the link then it's called
                        temporally shared or Time shared line configuration.</dd>

                it was developed. Instance messaging can now allow user to talk in real time and send files
                to other people
                wherever
                they are in the world, which ids huge boon for businesses. Also it allows access toa vast
                amount of useful
                information, including traditional reference materials and timely facts, such as news and
                current events.
                <br>
                <b> 2.It allow for more convenient resource sharing.</b>
                This benefit is very important , particular for larger companies that really need to produce
                huge number of
                resources to be shared to all the people. Since the technology involves computer-based work,
                it is assured
                that
                the
                resources they wanted to get across would be completely shared by connecting toa computer
                network which
                their
                audiences is also using. <br>
                <b>3.It makes sharing easier.</b>
                Computer networking allows easier accessibility for people to share their files, which
                greatly helps them
                with
                saving more time and effort, since they could do files sharing more accordingly and
                effectively. <br>
                <b>4. It is highly flexible.</b>
                This technology is known to be very flexible, as it gives user the opportunities to explore
                everything about
                essential things, such as software without effecting their functionality . plus people will
                have the
                accessibility
                to all information they needed to gets and share. <br>
                <b>5.It is an inexpensive system.</b>
                Installing networking software on your device would not cost to much, as your are assured
                that it last and
                can
                effectively share information to your peers. Also, there is no need to change the software
                regularly, as
                mostly
                it
                is not required to do so. <br>
                <b>6. It increases the cost efficiency.</b>
                With computer networking you can use a lot of software products available on the market
                which can just be
                stored
                or
                installed in your system or ever, and can be used by various workstation. <br>
                <b>7.It boosts the storage capacity</b>
                Since you are going to share information, files and resources to other people , you ensure
                all data and
                content
                are
                properly stored in your system. With this networking technology , you can do all of these
                without hassle,
                while
                having all the space you need for storage.

                <h3>LIST OF DISADVANTAGES OF A COMPUTER NETWORKING:</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>1. It lacks independence.</b>
                    Computer networking involves a process that is operated using computer, so people will
                    be
                    relying more of a
                    computer
                    work, instead of exerting an effort for their tasks at hand. Aside from this, they will
                    be
                    dependent on main
                    file
                    server, which means that, if it breaks down , the system would become useless, making
                    users
                    idle. <br>
                    <b> 2. It poses the security difficulties.</b>
                    Because there would be huge number of people who would be using computer network to get
                    and
                    share some of
                    their
                    files and resources, a certain user&apos;s security would be always at risk. <br>

                <h6>Introduction to Computer Networking</h6>
                <b> 3. It allows for more presence of computer viruses and malware.</b>
                There would be instance that stored files get corrupted due to computer viruses. Thus
                -network administrator
                should
                conduct regular check-ups on the and the stored files at same time. <br>
                <b> 4. It requires an efficient network administrator.</b>
                For computer network to work efficiently and optimally, it requires high technical
                skills
                and know how of
                its
                operations and administrations. A person just having basic skill cannot do this job.
                <br>
                <b> 5. It lacks robustness.</b>
                As previous stated, if a computer network&apos;s main server breaks down, the entire
                system
                would become useless.
                Also if
                it has a bridging device or a center linking server fails, the entire network would also
                come to a
                standstill.
                To
                deal with these problems, huge networks should have a powerful computer to serve as file
                server to make
                setting
                up
                and maintaining the network easier. <br>
                <b> 6. It requires an expensive set-up.</b>
                Through the computer networks are said to be an inexpensive system when it I already
                running, its initial
                set up
                cost can still be high depending on the number of computers to be connected, Expensive
                devices, such as
                routers,
                switches, hubs etc., can add up to the cost,. Aside from these, it would also need
                network
                interface cards
                (NICs)
                for workstation in case they are not built in.
